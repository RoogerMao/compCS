# Why are there two files?
There are two files here because I wasn't able to solve this problem. attemptedSolution.cpp is my attempt, and twoTables.cpp is a solution I copied from Saksham Rustagi.
I rewrote out his solution so I could better understand it, I don't claim to have solved this problem myself.
